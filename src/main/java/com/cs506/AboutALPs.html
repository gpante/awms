					Our Mission and Who We Are</button>
				<p id="missionStatement" style="margin-left: 50px; display: none;">The
					mission of the Adventure Learning Programs (ALPs) is to challenge
					people through adventure-based learning to discover themselves and
					understand those around them. We are a leadership organization that
					operates under the philosophy of Experiential Education where
					learners are purposefully engaged in direct experience and focused
					reflection in order to learn new skills. We offer adventure-based
					team building workshops that incorporate initiatives, problem
					solving activities, and high and low ropes course experiences. We
					are located on the third floor of the Red Gym and are sponsored by
					the Center for Leadership and Involvement. Because we are funded by
					segregated fees, ALPS workshops are free to all UW Students!</p>

					<b style="font-weight: bold;">GROWTH:</b>&nbsp We are committed to
					providing opportunities that promote continued personal and group
					development, learning, and discovery while respecting the fact that
					growth looks different for everyone. <br>
					<br> <b style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;">COMMUNITY:</b>&nbsp
					We strive to create an environment within our organization and in
					our workshops that is characterized by mutual respect and support
					so learning can occur. <br>
					<br> <b style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;">EMPOWERMENT:</b>&nbsp
					We strive to create opportunities for our staff and participants to
					strengthen their self-confidence and sense of agency in their daily
					lives. <br>
					<br> <b style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;">AUTHENTICITY:</b>&nbsp
					We model authenticity within our workshops and our community
					because we believe that the genuineness of our engagement with one
					another fosters self-discovery and growth. <br>
					<br> <b style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;">DIVERSITY
						AND INCLUSION:</b>&nbsp We value the unique perspectives and life
					experiences present both in our community and the communities we
					serve. We intentionally design our workshops to promote inclusive
					spaces where differences are celebrated.
