					Mission and Who We Are</button>
				<p style="margin-left: 50px;">The mission of the Adventure
					Learning Programs (ALPs) is to challenge people through
					adventure-based learning to discover themselves and understand
					those around them. We are a leadership organization that operates
					under the philosophy of Experiential Education where learners are
					purposefully engaged in direct experience and focused reflection in
					order to learn new skills. We offer adventure-based team building
					workshops that incorporate initiatives, problem solving activities,
					and high and low ropes course experiences. We are located on the
					third floor of the Red Gym and are sponsored by the Center for
					Leadership and Involvement. Because we are funded by segregated
					fees, ALPS workshops are free to all UW Students!</p>

					<b style="font-weight: bold;">Growth</b> We are committed to
					providing opportunities that promote continued personal and group
					development, learning, and discovery while respecting the fact that
					growth looks different for everyone.
