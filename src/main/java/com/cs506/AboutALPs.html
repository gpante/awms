				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<button style="background-color:blue;">Our Mission and Who We Are</button>
				<p style="margin-left:50px;">
					The mission of the Adventure Learning Programs (ALPs) is to challenge people through adventure-based 
					learning to discover themselves and understand those around them.  We are a leadership organization 
					that operates under the philosophy of Experiential Education where learners are purposefully engaged 
					in direct experience and focused reflection in order to learn new skills.  We offer adventure-based 
					team building workshops that incorporate initiatives, problem solving activities, and high and low 
					ropes course experiences. We are located on the third floor of the Red Gym and are sponsored by the 
					Center for Leadership and Involvement. Because we are funded by segregated fees, ALPS workshops are 
					free to all UW Students!

					We are committed to providing opportunities that promote continued personal and group development, learning, and discovery while respecting the fact that growth looks different for everyone.
